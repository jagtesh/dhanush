Compiling this is quite easy. Make sure you'v got gcc and auto-make installed. Then hit the terminal and enter the directory with dhanush.

For compiling dhanush:
$ make dsh

For creating a zip file with the binary:
$ make zip

For cleaning all output files in the current directory
$ make clean

This was compiled and tested successfully on SUSE 10.1 and Fedora Core 6.
